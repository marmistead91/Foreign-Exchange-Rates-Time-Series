# Foreign Exchange Rates Time Series

## Background

The foreign exchange rate is based on the conversion of one coutries economy to anothers. Things that can factor into this are trade, economy, tourism and geo-political risk. Looking at the monthly exchange rates against the US dollar with other countries you can see when wars have broken out or economic calapes occured. After looking at the different countries I decided to try to preidct the foreign exchange between US and Australia. The main reason for this is becasue Australia has had the most consistent economy with the US, so hopefully we can come up with a good model for future predictions. 

## EDA

All of the countries were broken down by economic level so they are more digestable to look at.
